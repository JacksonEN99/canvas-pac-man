# Canvas Pac-Man
Just a simple demonstration of using HTML5's element and javascript to draw little Pac-Man's in your web browser.

Each pac-man is given a random: size, color, and speed. When a pac-man hits the edge of the web browser, it bounces off the wall, reverses the direction its mouth is pointing and slightly opens or closes its mouth a bit.
